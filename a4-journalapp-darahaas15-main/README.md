## Description

The software gives users a journal app, where one can set the time and date of journal entries, as well as delete them at will.

## Tasks

- **Task 1** \- Implemented the nav graph actions with the help of code from the class slides.
- **Task 2** \- Made database using Room, and implemented the DAOs and the repository, following lecture slides.
- **Task 3** \- Added a DELETE button to the menu bar of the EntryDetailsFragment view. Clicking on that button prompts a dialog to confirm that the user wants to delete the current entry.
- **Task 4** \- Share button that shows a dialog to select the app to share the entry with.
- **Task 5** \- Info app bar button that shows a dialog with the entry's date and time added.
- **Task 6** \- Ran accecibility tests on the app, and fixed the issues that were found. (Button color contrast issues, etc.)

## Testing

- Did not test during development, wrote tests after fixing multiple UI bugs and persist issues.

## Accessibility

- I used the accessibility scanner to evaluate my app's usability for users who areÂ visually impaired, and I followed its recommendations. Initially, it was recommended that in order to improve visibility, the contrast between the foreground and background on the button die may be enhanced. It suggested changing the "zeroes" because many of them were coincidental. It was unable to do this since it would have made the interface less readable and more convoluted.

## Completion Time

- It took me around 48 hours to complete all the tasks from the starter template.

## Difficulty Level

- 8/10
