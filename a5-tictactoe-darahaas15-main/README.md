## Description

A game of tic-tac-toe, with login / register features that lets the player play against a computer in single player mode or against other registered users in multiplayer mode.

## Testing

- Did not test during development, wrote tests after fixing multiple UI bugs and persist issues.

## Accessibility

- I used the accessibility scanner to evaluate my app's usability for users who areÂ visually impaired, and I followed its recommendations. Initially, it was recommended that in order to improve visibility, the contrast between the foreground and background on the button die may be enhanced. It suggested changing the "zeroes" because many of them were coincidental. It was unable to do this since it would have made the interface less readable and more convoluted.

## Running the app

- I have included the google-services.json file in my github repository, which contains the firebase api key, therefore the TA should be able to run the app directly by pulling from my repo. I know that including api keys is not good development practice, but I have done it for ease of evaluation and since the code is stored within a private repo of the organisation.

## Completion Time

- It took me around 48 hours to complete all the tasks from the starter template.

## Difficulty Level 

- 8/10
